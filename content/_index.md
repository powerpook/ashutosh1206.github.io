I am a final year undergraduate student at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/), Amritapuri Campus, India. Being in this University for the last 3.5 years, I have been an active member of team [bi0s](https://bi0s.in) - a [CTF](https://ctftime.org/team/662) and security research team, and have also been extremely fortunate to be given the opportunity to **lead the team** since mid-2018, along with two other teammates. 

I have been learning offensive cryptography since freshman year by playing CTFs, reading research papers and more. My love for cryptography and desire to give back to the community led me to create [Crypton](https://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton) - a library to learn and practice offensive and defensive cryptography, which at this point of time has **~780 stars** on GitHub. The library was also selected to be presented at [Crypto and Privacy Village](https://cryptovillage.org/), **[DEFCON 26](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-index.html)** and at [BSides San Francisco 2018](https://bsidessf.org/) security conference.

In my free time, I like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/100766792-ashutosh-ahelleya?shelf=to-read) about philosophy, politics, stoicism and productivity. 

<!-- All of this has contributed to my paranoia, although I believe I am no longer oblivious to most social, political happenings because of this. I rarely prefer reading *fantasy novels*. You can find my reading list for 2020 [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/100766792-ashutosh-ahelleya?shelf=to-read). -->

I enjoy writing, and I am a [strong supporter of Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L762WQtWcM). Because to these reasons, I regularly post [write-ups](writeups/) of crypto challenges that I find interesting. However, I do not publicly write about topics related to philosophy, politics yet. I believe most of my writings related to these topics are a bit crude as of now and need more polishing, which I plan to work on, in 2020.
